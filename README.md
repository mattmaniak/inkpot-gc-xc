# Inkpot GC XC
Gynvael Coldwind's inkpot_gc theme for GVim/Sublime ported to the Xcode.

`make` is required to install the theme for your user account and make it discoverable in Xcode. You can install this tool via a package manager called [Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/make#default). As a pedantic alternative you can copy the `Inkpot GC XC.xccolortheme` to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`.
